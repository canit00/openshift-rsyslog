= openshift-rsyslog
This is using DaemonSets and ConfigMaps to configure rsyslog on an OpenShift Cluster
to send all log files to an external rsyslog server.

== Setup Project
----
# oadm new-project rsyslog --node-selector=""
$ oc project rsyslog
----

=== Set SCC
The rsyslog pods need to run privileged in order to access certain system resources.
 * /etc/machine-id - read
 * /etc/hostname - read
 * /var/log - read/write
 * /run/log - read/write


As system:admin do the following:
----
# oadm policy add-scc-to-user privileged system:serviceaccount:rsyslog:default
----
